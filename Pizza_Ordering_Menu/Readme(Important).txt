This Java project implements a simple pizza ordering system, allowing users to order pizzas, garlic bread, and beverages. The program:

Collects customer details like name, email, phone number, and address.
Displays a menu and takes user inputs for the type and quantity of items (pizza, garlic bread, beverages).
Calculates the total bill based on the selected items and their prices.
Applies a discount if the total exceeds $50.
Displays the order summary and customer details.
Key concepts used:

Variables: Store customer details, prices, and quantities.
Conditional Logic: Used for determining pizza size prices, applying discounts, and handling invalid menu choices.
Loops: Handle repeated item selections until the user decides to stop.
Functions: Modularity is achieved by dividing the tasks (e.g., calculating prices, applying discounts) into separate methods for reusability and clarity.
